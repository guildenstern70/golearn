### Setup

You should have a single workspace repository for all of your GO 
code, and a GOPATH pointing to that.

It is advisable to have a /src directory inside your workspace.

This code must be installed in a directory inside

    $GOPATH/src

with the following path

    github.com/guildenstern70/golearn
    
so that you find the LICENSE file here:

    $GOPATH/src/github.com/guildenstern70/golearn/LICENSE
    
 ### Build
 
 You build the executable file by running
 
    go install github.com/guildenstern70/golearn
 
 ### Run
 
 Run the built assembly with

    $GOPATH/bin/golearn.exe (Windows)
    $GOPATH/bin/golearn (Mac + Linux)

 ### Test
 Run the test suite of this project by running
 
    go test github.com/guildenstern70/golearn/core
